# README File

## Overview

This github repository is for Andrew Wright's CPSC 8430 Homework 1 assignment. The homework assignment is split into 3 main sections which correspond to the 3 main folders you'll see. All code is contained in Jupyter notebooks and can be ran. The libraries used throughout the homework problems are the usual ones: torch, numpy, pandas, sklearn, random, etc. Please reach out with any issues or concerns if you are unable to run the code.

## Data

The only dataset that has been downloaded is the MNIST dataset. It is stored in the "data" folder. Running the notebooks will not redownload data if this folder is present. It will only download the data if this file is not in the correct relative path that is specified.

## 1.1 Deep vs Shallow

There are 2 subfolders here, one for each part. I have simulated 2 functions, so there are 2 separate notebooks. The actual task that I trained on for part 2 was the MNIST dataset. Running the notebooks in these folders will also generate the png images of the graphs.

## 1.2 Optimization

There are 2 notebooks for this section. The "optimization_visualization" notebook will complete parts 1 and 2. Part 3 is done by the second notebook (time permitting). Running the notebooks in these folders will also generate the png images of the graphs.

## 1.3 Generalization

There are 4 notebooks in this section. 1 for each question and part of question (question 3 has 2 parts). Running the notebooks in these folders will also generate the png images of the graphs.
